# Web Editor
## Summary
This is a GUI sketch to test a couple of ideas for a new editorial workflow based on planning (all/most items created are the result of a ticket assignment in a planning meeting).

It is also a technology exploration, using PouchDB for local storage. The idea is to be able to work in offlince mode and then being able to simply sync to a backend instance once online. Exploring CounchDB/PouchDB for this piece. Also exploring full screen mode in JavaScript, drag and drop and more.

It is not and official product, best-practice JavaScript, or anything in that direction. It is a sketchpad.

## What's next?
1. Mockup TODO (ticket view) and make it first page
2. Link TODO ticket items to Write view and content item created automatically for ticket, so that you only have to click an item to start working on it
3. Figure out a nice way to work with workflow state on content items
4. Fix upload/sync to a CounchDB backend
5. Fix image load and support for multiple images
6. Fix the way component names are encoded in the DOM using own attributes (only half fixed now)
7. Add support for "real templates"
8. Keyboard shortcuts
9. Add in mock stats/dashboard
